## About this Repository

This repository contains the complete **Padre Gino's Pizza Ordering App** - a full-stack React application built throughout the Frontend Masters course. The app demonstrates modern web development practices with a React frontend and Node.js backend.

### Project Structure:

- **`18-deploying/pizza-client-app/`** - Production-ready React frontend
- **`api/`** - Fastify backend server with SQLite database
- **`01-17/`** - Course lesson snapshots for learning reference

Every step of the project built throughout the course will have a folder that will be a snapshot of the current state of the project. The naming format will be `XX-<name of the lesson>` so you can get a rough idea of order and which lesson the step is coming from. In each snapshot you'll have to run `npm install` again since they are another whole copy of the project.
